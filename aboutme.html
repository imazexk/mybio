<p><br>hello, my name is mazhar khan, i am proficient in <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/"> html </a>, javascript, and ruby. i have 2 years experience working as a web developer, i can step up and make immediate contributions.<br>

<br>i graduated from <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu">city college</a> with a B.S in computer science. one of the companies i previously worked at was infomaze inc. which is a company that provides information on how to start a small business and obtain financing. while at infomaze, i had hands on experience maintaining there website, which helped me to utilize my html, css and javascript skills.<br>
